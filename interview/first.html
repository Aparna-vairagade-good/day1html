    <h1>HTML INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h1>
<h1>DAY 1.</h1>
<h1>1.Differance between div and span?</h1>
<li>The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of in-line HTML whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code. Save this answer.</li><br>
   <li>Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. However, they serve different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling.</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>2.Differance between class and IDS ?</h2>
<ul>
    <li> The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.</li><br>
    <li>The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.What are self closing tag?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>↑ The full list of valid self-closing tags in HTML5 is: area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, keygen, link, meta, param, source, track, and wbr. </li>
    <h1>list of self-closing tag:</h1>
    <li> (area/) </li>
    <li> (base/)</li>
    <li> (br/) </li>
    <li> (col/) </li>
    <li>(hr/) </li>
</ul>
<h1>4.How many types of headings are there ? How to decide which to use where</h1>
<ul>
    <li>HTML defines six levels of headings, and these heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6. The H1 element is the highest or most important level, and the H6 element is the least important. These different heading levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content on a page.</li><br>
    <li>There are three types of headings: question headings. statement headings. topic headings.</li>
</ul>
<h1>5.Diferance between block and inline?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur (although, as usual, this can be changed using CSS).</li><br>
    <li>Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency. Inline elements don't start in a new line. Block elements always start in a line. Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.</li>
</ul>
<h1>7.What are attributes ?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 : a quality, character, or characteristic ascribed to someone or something has leadership attributes. 2 : an object closely associated with or belonging to a specific person, thing, or office a scepter is the attribute of power especially : such an object used for identification in painting or sculpture.</li>
</ul>
<h1>6.Differance between em and strong ?</h1`>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it. The <em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice.</li><br>
        <li>Yeah, the definition of what ‘strong emphasis’ is compared to just ‘emphasis’ is pretty woolly. The only standard definition would be “it's emphasised, but more!!”. </li>
</ul>
